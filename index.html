						<p style="color:#130303">In a broad sense, philosophy is an activity people undertake when they seek to understand fundamental truths about themselves, the world in which they live, and their relationships to the world and to each other. As an academic discipline philosophy is much the same. Those who study philosophy are perpetually engaged in asking, answering, and arguing for their answers to life’s most basic questions. To make such a pursuit more systematic academic philosophy is traditionally divided into major areas of study.  </p>

						<p style="font-size: 26px; color: #130303;" class="fragment">Philosophy may be called the "science of sciences" probably in the sense that it is, in effect, the self-awareness of the sciences and the source from which all the sciences draw their world-view and methodological principles, which in the course of centuries have been honed down into concise forms. 
							Complementary to its role in conceptual clarification, philosophy can contribute to the critique of scientific assumptions—and can even be proactive in formulating novel, testable, and predictive theories that help set new paths for empirical research.</p>

							Art falls within aesthetics. It could also be related to other branches of philosophy. For example, a cartoon (art) can be used to make an ethical or political statement, a political action could conflict with ethics, a political or ethical statement might not be logical.

						<p style="font-size: 24px; color: #130303;" class="fragment">Philosophy has been described as having taken a “computational turn,” referring to the ways in which computers and information technology throw new light upon traditional philosophical issues, provide new tools and concepts for philosophical reasoning, and pose theoretical and practical questions that cannot readily be approached within traditional philosophical frameworks. As such, computer technology is arguably the technology that has had the most profound impact on philosophy. Philosophers have studied computer technology and its philosophical implications extensively. Philosophers have discovered computers and information technology (IT) as research topics, and a wealth of research is taking place on philosophical issues in relation to these technologies. The research agenda is broad and diverse. Issues that are studied include the nature of computational systems, the ontological status of virtual worlds, the limitations of artificial intelligence, philosophical aspects of data modeling, the political regulation of cyberspace, the epistemology of Internet information, ethical aspects of information privacy and security, and many more.</p>

					<h3>How is logic related to philosophy?</h3>
					<p style="font-size: 26px; color: #130303;" class="fragment fade-up">Philosophical logic is the branch of study that concerns questions about reference, predication, identity, truth, quantification, existence, entailment, modality, and necessity. Philosophical logic is the application of formal logical techniques to philosophical problems. 
					Nothing in philosophy can be done without logic– logic is the basis of philosophy. Think about it this way: philosophy, over anything else, is primarily concerned with truth. If someone makes a statement about something, say, for example, “the earth is flat”, how do you prove to them that is or is not? You give them reasons for why your belief is true. If your reasons for something being true make sense, that is, that they are logical, then your belief can be considered true.  </p>

						<h4>Is philosophy needed in the world of today or not?</h4>
						<p style="font-size: 26px; color: #130303;">Yes! Because philosophy can help us live more meaningful lives and build better societies. We just need a framework of philosophy that fits our modern-day problems. To win true freedom, you must be a slave to philosophy. Philosophy is still relevant today, not only because it tells us how to think, but also what is important to think about in life. philosophy provides the tools for us to become good thinkers, which is perhaps the most important skill there is. We should live with the right ethics, and correct reasoning.  </p>
